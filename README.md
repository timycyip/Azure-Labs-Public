# Azure Labs - Public Repository

Enterprise-grade Azure laboratories built with Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC), following Microsoft's Azure Landing Zone architecture patterns and best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è What This Repository Contains

Hands-on labs for implementing **Azure Landing Zones** - Microsoft's proven architectural framework for enterprise-scale cloud adoption. Each lab demonstrates real-world scenarios using Terraform with Azure Verified Modules (AVM).

| Lab Environment | Purpose | Key Components | Cost |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|------|
| **[azure-arch-landing-zone-lab01](./azure-arch-landing-zone-lab01/)** | **Platform Zone Foundation** | Management Groups, Azure Policies, Monitoring | ~$20-30/month |
| **[azure-arch-landing-zone-lab02](./azure-arch-landing-zone-lab02/)** | **Application Zone** | Python Flask Web App, Azure Front Door, Application Insights | ~$35-40/month |

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Azure Landing Zone Patterns**: Enterprise architecture framework and management group hierarchies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Production-ready Terraform with Azure Verified Modules and state management
- **Security & Compliance**: 50+ Azure Policies, Zero Trust networking, managed identities, and RBAC
- **Cost Optimization**: Deploy enterprise-grade solutions on minimal budgets using free/basic tiers
- **Real-World Applications**: Python Flask web apps with CDN, monitoring, and GitHub integration

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with contributor access
- Terraform ~1.9 or later
- Azure CLI for authentication

### Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timycyip/Azure-Labs-Public.git
   cd Azure-Labs-Public
   ```

2. **Configure Variables**
   For `azure-arch-landing-zone-lab01`, refer to https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones/ for detailed instructions and to customize your own variables.
   
   For the rest,
   ```bash
   cp variables.tf terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your Azure subscription details
   ```

3. **Deploy Platform Foundation (Lab 01)**
   refer to https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones/

4. **Deploy Application Workloads (Lab 02)**
   ```bash
   cd ../azure-arch-landing-zone-lab02
   # Create your terraform.tfvars file based on variables.tf
   cp variables.tf terraform.tfvars
   # Edit with your subscription and environment details
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

**Important**: Each lab requires creating a `terraform.tfvars` file based on the `variables.tf` file. Define your variables (subscription_id, tenant_id, environment, etc.) and you're ready to deploy.
